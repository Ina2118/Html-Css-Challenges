## Projects

### Front-End Abstract (Level 1)

This project was created to practice coding by working on templates. The design template was taken from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/), a website that offers free front-end challenges and templates with three difficulty levels. This project is part of **Level 1**, which focuses on fundamental front-end skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


### Image Accordion
A small project from [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech), which provides interactive coding exercises and front-end challenges for learning web development. This project focuses on creating an accordion effect with images using HTML and CSS.

### Solar Eclipse
Another challenge from [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech), designed to practice layout and styling with HTML and CSS by replicating a solar eclipse animation/graphic.

### A Valentine’s Day Card
This is my own original idea, created to practice HTML and CSS by designing a themed card for Valentine’s Day.
