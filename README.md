## Projects

### [Front-End Abstract](./Front-End-Abstract)
This project was created to practice coding by working on templates. The design template was taken from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/), a website that offers free front-end challenges and templates to help developers improve their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

### [Image Accordion](./Image-Accordion)
A small project from [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech), which provides interactive coding exercises and front-end challenges for learning web development. This project focuses on creating an accordion effect with images using HTML and CSS.

### [Solar Eclipse](./Solar-Eclipse)
Another challenge from [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech), designed to practice layout and styling with HTML and CSS by replicating a solar eclipse animation/graphic.

### [A Valentine’s Day Card](./Valentines-Day-Card)
This is my own original idea, created to practice HTML and CSS by designing a themed card for Valentine’s Day.
